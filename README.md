QR Code Generator

This is a Java program that generates QR codes. The program uses the ZXing library to generate the QR codes.

Getting Started

To use this program, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. Once you have Java installed, you can run the program by following these steps:

Download the program files from GitHub.
Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the program files.
Compile the program by running the command javac QRCodeGenerator.java.
Run the program by running the command java QRCodeGenerator.
The program will prompt you to enter the data that you want to encode in the QR code, as well as the file path for the QR code image. Once you have entered this information, the program will generate the QR code and save it to the specified file path.

Customizing the QR Code

If you want to customize the size or shape of the QR code, you can modify the program code. The program uses the ZXing library to generate the QR code, so you can modify the settings of the QRCodeWriter object to change the size and error correction level of the QR code. You can also modify the program code to draw a custom shape on the QR code image, using standard Java graphics APIs.
